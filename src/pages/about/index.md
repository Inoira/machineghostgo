**_In my quest to achieve my destiny_**

**_I digress and transcend text_**

**_Perplex those who listening with mysterious dictioning_**

**_Spirits in the mist whispering, I'm listening_**

**_Unwritten lyrics falsifying fiction_**

**_Zinging like a little spice over curried rice_**

**_Not about my cheese that's for mice, I'm about life_**

**_Can't place a monetary value on the soul's price_**

**_I'm thrice returned to the world of men, trinity of heaven_**

**_Plus seven chakras, so my level stays at ten_**

**_Because the dead sea scrolls were doctored by monsters and mobsters_**

**_Papa wants me to play doctor, tape was broken, fix it proper_**

**_But in the end gotta break it to make it, heal back stronger_**

**_Amen_**
