  “Star seeds birthed me from woman unearthly”


  …


  What makes a mother? Why is the responsibility of growth consistently given to
  mothers? Why is it so powerful? Death defying? How does motherhood seem to
  carry itself across bloodlines, even? What does it mean to love, as a mother
  is tasked - unconditionally? What does it mean that this love is also one of
  molding and conditioning? 


  ….


  This piece seeks to explore questions, standards, and iterations of the
  natural love of survival and growth, from “Mother’s Nature” to “Mother
  Nature”.


  ….              

  The day to celebrate mothers is everyday!!
